# pKernelInterface-EFT

An (External) Escape From Tarkov Reversal project. (One of my older projects which i updated a little so people could use it if they needed)

The use of OOP techniques used in this project aren't my best, but it's something.

Excuse the overuse of threads, junk code, performance, mismatch of data types, etc.

I've also left some code in there that i was using for testing/debugging, etc.
